## 💼 Fullstack Intern — Demaze Technologies

_Feb 2023 – Jun 2023_

At [Demaze](https://www.demaze.in/) Technologies, I worked as a Fullstack Developer Intern, contributing to both frontend and backend development for web applications. I was involved in building clean, responsive interfaces and integrating them with robust backend services.

### 🔧 Key Contributions

- 💻 Developed and maintained **React.js** components with a focus on usability and reusability.
- 🖌️ Designed responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS**, following design mockups and Figma files.
- 🔄 Created RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, enabling secure communication between client and server.
- 🗂️ Handled database operations using **MongoDB**, including creating schemas, queries, and data management.
- 🔗 Integrated frontend and backend systems to ensure smooth data flow and user experience.
- 🧹 Followed clean coding practices and participated in regular code reviews to maintain code quality.
- 🤝 Collaborated in an agile team environment, contributing to planning, development, and testing cycles.

This internship helped me gain practical experience in fullstack development and gave me a deeper understanding of how frontend and backend systems work together in production environments.
